### Mobile Development of a Category-Based Contact Storage Application

This application seeks to provide a simple and intuitive interface focused on storing the basic information of one’s network in addition to user-defined categories representing their relationship to the user. This is aimed towards providing the ability to search within one’s network with less guesswork of names and/or numbers, which I have noticed is a large problem as the size of one's contact book grows.

The GIF below shows a simple run of the app demonstrating the basic functionality of the app: viewing contact cards, sorting based on category's, viewing contact information, adding a contact, editing a contact, and searching contacts by description, first name, and last name.
